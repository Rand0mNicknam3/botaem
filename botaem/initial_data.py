        We recommend you to start with understanting of the basics, here some materials\
            that will help you to get started:\n Syntax:\n "Learning python" by Mark Lutz,\n\
                  "Fluent Python" by Luciano Ramalho,\n \
                    If you prefer to watch videos, here some YT channels: \n \
                        "FreeCodeCamp" and their "Harvard CS50 Introduction to Programming with Python", "Python for beginners" courses\n \
                            "Timofey Khiryanov" channel is also imbulechka for ru-speaking audience(or use yandex AI video translator)\n \
            After syntax you also nned some basic algorithms and data structures:\n \
                "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava,\n \
                    "Algorithms" by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne,\n \
            Next step is OOP and patterns of proggraming:\n \
                "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" by Band of four,\n \
                    "OOP analysis and Desing with Appication" by Booch Grady,\n \
            Also you will need to know how to write "clean" code:\n \
                "Clean Code: by Robert Martin\n, "Code Complete" by Steve McConnell,\n \
                    "Refactoring" by Martin Fowler\n \
            This is only about python, to become a real developer you will probably also need knowledge of:\n \
                Networks, databases, basics of operations systems, etc.\n \
